# iamzanahoria.io README

Hi! this is the repo of my personal page iamzanahoria.io, this is a personal experimenting page to improve my Ruby and Ruby on Rails coding skills, while I document myself and learn new things through books, videos, podcast, etc.

Visiting the page you'll find a code blog section (where I'll cover in detail the things I learned and the new features I implemented on the page), a photo journal section (hey! I'm new in the photo hobby, so join me on my journey to improve my photos with my analog camera) and a bookshelf section (here you can see the books that I had read and the one I'm currently reading).

Project data:

- Ruby version: Ruby 3.2.0

- Rails version: Rails 7.0.4.1

- Tailwind

- Font Awesome icons
